# CS50  

This repository is my code for following along with the [CS50 course by Harvard University](https://thijs.click/edx-cs50). It's grouped by week and subdivided into practice files and problem sets.

Please, keep in mind the course's policy on academic honesty! Let my code of the problem sets be an inspiration, but try to figure it out yourself.
