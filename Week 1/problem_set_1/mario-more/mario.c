   Problem set:
   In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-more, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

        #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
    And letâ€™s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

*/

// Include libaries
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

/*
do
{
    // Ask user for number for how tall the piramids should be
    int heightPiramids = get_int("How high should the pyramids be? Give me a number between 1 and 8: ");
}
while(heightPiramids <= 1 || heightPiramids => 8); */



// For each row
    // Print spaces
    int spaces = heightPiramids - 1
    for
    // Print left hashes
    for (int i = 1; i <= heightPiramids; i++)
    // Print gap
    int gap = " " + " ";
    // Print right hashes

    VOORBEELD 3
    spaces, spaces, leftHash, gap, rightHash,
    spaces, leftHash, leftHash, gap, rightHash, rightHash
    leftHash, leftHash, leftHash, gap, rightHash, rightHash, rightHash


// Main function
int main()
{

    // Create variables for spaces, hashes and gap
    int spaces = " ";
    int leftHash = "#";
    int rightHash = "#";
    int gap = "  ";

    // Ask user for number for how tall the piramids should be
    int heightPiramids = get_int("How high should the pyramids be? Give me a number between 1 and 8: ");

    // Check if the number is valid
    if (heightPiramids > 0 && heightPiramids < 9)
    {
        // Build the pyramid
        for (int i = 1; i <= heightPiramids; i++)
        {
            printf("%s%s%s%s%s%s", spaces, leftHash, gap, rightHash, gap, leftHash);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Ask the question again
        printf("Not a correct number\n");
    }

    // Create a for loop with the right height
